|Sr.No | Name of paper| Basic Idea | Link to website | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 1 | [Code2Vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09473.pdf) | Neural Model for representing snippets of code as continuous distributed vectors (“code embeddings”) | [https://code2vec.org/](https://code2vec.org/) |
| 2 | [Graph Convolutional Policy Network for Goal-Directed Molecular Graph Generation](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7877-graph-convolutional-policy-network-for-goal-directed-molecular-graph-generation.pdf) | Graph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN), a general graph convolutional network based model for goal-directed graph generation through reinforcement learning. | [Github](https://github.com/bowenliu16/rl_graph_generation) |
| 3 | [Dynamic Routing Between Capsules](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6975-dynamic-routing-between-capsules.pdf) | Capsules introduce a new building block that can be used in deep learning to better model hierarchical relationships inside of internal knowledge representation of a neural network. Intuition behind them is very simple and elegant | [Github](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras) |
| 4 | [Struc2vec : Learning Node Representations from Structural Identity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03165.pdf) | Flexible framework for learning latent representations for the structural identity of nodes. Struc2vec uses a hierarchy to measure node similarity at different scales, and constructs a multilayer graph to encode structural similarities and generate structural context for nodes. | [Github](https://github.com/leoribeiro/struc2vec) |
